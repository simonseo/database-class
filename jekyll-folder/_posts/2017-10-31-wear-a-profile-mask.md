In this project, I try to imagine what society will look like when we achieve unobtrusive AR experience. As had all new waves of technology, AR will greatly impact the way individuals interacts with each other.

When technology allows and the social platform provided, people will start to incorporate virtual clothing as part of their fashion, just as people do in online games. Some of the implications that I discuss here are some known phenomena in online games.

### Demo
Here’s a video of a simple webpage I created to demonstrate this.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XD2LUXtNX-s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In the current implementation, this app uses machine learning to learn people’s faces to remember their name and what GIF they want to be represented as. After the app learns a face, it puts the GIF “skin” on the user’s face, along with their name for the convenience of viewers to recognize who that is. For this to be seamless In an actual AR environment, each individual would have to broadcast their “skin” for others to see directly or each viewer would have to ask a central server what each person’s profile skin is, as in Facebook.

### Economic Implications
If this culture of virtual skin becomes widespread, there will be an industry transition from physical textile industry to virtual fashion design.
As a result there will be a thinning of distinction between the concepts of designing and fabrication. Clothing is created the moment it is designed, as opposed to being designed on paper/computer and then made with physical fabric.
Another result will be that there will either be more law enforcement on the protection of clothing designs, or on the other extreme there may be a culture of open source and free clothing designs.

Halloween Parades and Fashion Shows will definitely become more extravagant, elaborate, and diverse; they may or not become an easier field since the available technology will diversify and actually render the designing to be more intricate and complicated.


### Social Implications
Virtually-naked-fashion or virtual-bad-hair-day will be in style. In the current society, being naked or having a bad hair day would be something most would feel embarrassed about. However, if everyone is convinced that one is not really naked or has a bad hair day, or if it just doesn’t matter anymore, these embarrassing styles will actually become a funny, practical, or even fashionable outfit.

While the virtual fashion may become audacious, there will be a new code of conduct to not stare at others’ physical appearances. This is because the role of physical clothes will diminish to that of underwears now. Usually people spend less time thinking about the visual design then the practical design. I imagine design of physical clothing in general will become more geared towards practicality than beauty.

I imagine that people will place more emphasis on non visual aspects of a person, such as their speech, scent, or personality. This is not to say that people will not care about the visual aspect. Indeed, I believe people will take beauty for granted and thus expect more of other people’s visuals.


### Technological Implications
If it does become rude to look at individuals’ physical appearance or if virtual faces become indistinguishable from real faces, how will we check photo IDs? The risk of fraud may increase; on the other hand, people will realise photo IDs were never secure from the first place and use actually secure forms of IDs.

Should other people’s fashion be overridable? E.g., should people be able to put a pig-face on me instead of a Beyonce-face that I had set for myself? This happens in smartphone contact books, where one can set whatever nickname and profile picture for someone else. This does not happen in the case of Facebook profile pictures. The owner sets a photo that is forced to be seen by everyone else.
